## CORE PYTHON PROBLEMS 

1. Write a Python script hello.py that prints “Hello, Python World!” and execute it from the terminal.

2. Assign your name to a variable and print its type using type().
Create three variables — an integer, a float, and a string — and print their types.

3. Create a list, tuple, set, and dictionary and print each.
Try to add an element to a tuple — what happens?

4. - Convert a float to an integer, a string to an int, and an int to a string.
    - Take a string "123.45" and convert it to a float, then to an int (observe what happens).
    - Given nums = [1, 2, 3], convert it into a string: '1,2,3'.

5. Write a program to calculate area and perimeter of a rectangle.

6. Given two numbers, print the quotient and remainder using // and %.

7. Compute 2 ** 5 and explain the result.

8. Create a list and demonstrate all major list methods.

9. Use a tuple to store coordinates (x, y) and try modifying it.

10. Create a dictionary for a student: {"name": "Bing", "age": 21, "marks": 89} and print keys, values, and items.

11. Create two sets and perform union, intersection, and difference.

12. Take a string "Python is fun" and:
    - Split it into words.
    - Replace "fun" with "awesome".
    - Reverse it using slicing.
    - Format it to say "Learning Python is awesome!" using f-strings.

13. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

14. Write a function that prints factorial of a number using recursion.

15. Write a function describe_person(name, age=18) that prints name and age.

16. Create a function using *args to add any number of integers.

17. Add a docstring explaining what the function does and how to use it.

18. Import math and compute square root of 144.

19. Use os to create a new directory called "test_folder".

20. Create your own module named greetings.py that has a hello() function, then import and use it.

21. Create a virtual environment and install requests.

22. Write code that handles division by zero using try-except.

23. Write a function that raises a ValueError if input is negative.

24. Add else and finally blocks to see the order of execution.

25. Create a custom exception class called InvalidAgeError.

26. Create a decorator that prints "Function is being executed" before calling the actual function.

27. Write a decorator that measures execution time of a function.

28. Write a generator that yields squares of numbers up to n.

29. Create an infinite generator of even numbers.

30. Use next() to get first 5 values.

31. Create a list of squares for numbers 1–10 using list comprehension.

32. Make a dictionary of numbers and their cubes using dict comprehension.

33. Filter even numbers from a list using list comprehension.

34. Create a nested comprehension for multiplication table.

35. Convert a Python dictionary into a JSON string.

36. Write a Python object to a file in JSON format.

37. Serialize and deserialize a Python object using pickle.
